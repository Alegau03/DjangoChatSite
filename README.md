# DjangoChatSite
A site realised in python using the djgango library that allows the creation of rooms and chat between several users within them.


Log in, log out, sing up, an administration page for creating new rooms are implemented.

Project executed by means of a tutorial to which modifications have been made.
It allowed me to understand how the library works in order to develop new skills in website programming and deepen my knowledge of the Python language.
